quizzer
=======

Input: a classlist of student IDs
Output: a CSV of 
studentIDExists      <tab> 1
studentIDDoesntExist <tab> 0

Purpose: Allows you mark a big stack of attendance items by typing in 2 characters per students.

Use:

perl quizzer.pl yourclassids

-> s<tab>
-> s<tab>
student1 student2 student3
-> student<tab>
student1 student2 student3
-> student1
student1 1
-> a<tab>
-> abram
abram 1
-> hi<tab>
-> hindle1
hindle1 1

As you record studentIDs they are removed from the list of possible completions.
Thus the more students you enter in the faster you can navigate to existing students.

This means you type 2 to 4 characters per student and can check off an entire class quickly!
